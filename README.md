# CS-255_SNHU
A repository for the work completed in Southern New Hampshire University CS-255, Systems Analysis and Design.

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

- In this course, we created a business requirements document and a system design document for a fictional company, DriverPass. DriverPass wanted to develop a system allowing users to purchase educational packages, schedule in-person training, and take online courses and practice tests to help them pass their driver's test. 

What did you do particularly well?

-I struggled quite a bit with this project. Honestly, I don't think system design is for me. There is a level of detail that is required that I continually fail to grasp. If I did anything particularly well, I would think it would be my charts. The CASE tool was easy to use and the diagrams and charts made it easy for me to see what information was needed.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

-It is diffucult to pick just one part of the project to improve, as I think much of it can be. I would try to make the whole project more detailed, with better in-depth explanations for the system to be designed.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

-It is improtat to consider the users needs when desinging a system because the user is the one who will be using the system you desgin. Creating a system that doesn't meet users needs and expectations will result in an unsatisfied customer. In this project I considered the users needs at every step and tired to include features that weren't specifically asked for, but were needed such as a log-in. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

-I approched desinging the software by first considering the needs that were stated in the interiew and extrapolaing from there what systems would be needed to support those needs. In the future, I would work on a system more methodically, fully breaking down the needs of one part of the system before moving on to the next part of the system. for example, I would outline everything needed for a "log-in" page before moving on to outling the package purchasing.
